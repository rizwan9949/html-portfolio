<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey into web development has been both exciting and unconventional. Although I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree, my passion for technology and the digital world led me to pursue a career in web development. The decision to transition from business studies to coding wasn't easy, but my curiosity and determination to stay relevant in today's tech-driven landscape fueled my desire to learn and grow in this field.</p>

<p>As a new web developer, I've dedicated myself to mastering the essential skills needed to create functional and visually appealing websites. I’ve been actively learning various programming languages and tools to build responsive, user-friendly websites that meet modern standards. My background in business administration gives me a unique perspective on understanding client needs, allowing me to create solutions that are not only technically sound but also aligned with broader business goals.</p>

<p>I’m excited about this new chapter in my professional journey. Combining my business acumen with my growing technical expertise, I am confident in my ability to bring value to any project I undertake.
